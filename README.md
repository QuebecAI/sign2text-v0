# Sign Language to Text (A to Z) with Artificial Intelligence | Pre-Alpha Demo

Transfer learning to predict Sign to Text from a webcam. For Humans.

This pre-alpha demo version supports the 26 letters of the English alphabet. We use a pretrained [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model and train another model using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 26 different classes. Thank you [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) for your flexible and intuitive APIs. A pure JavaScript implementation built on top of :
    [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) and
    [Transfer Learning Via Webcam](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/webcam-transfer-learning).
